    <h1 class="w3-center">Clinical Information for Cataract Surgery Co-Management</h1>

    <p>Thank you for co-managing your patients with Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC. We'd like to
      coordinate our care with you to ensure your patient has a pleasant, safe, and seamless surgical
      experience. Below please find some information that will describe our standard clinical pathway
      and give you some helpful information about caring for cataract surgery patients with us.</p>

    <p>Some patients' care may deviate from this pathway. Always use your clinical judgement in
      deciding on the care of a particular patient. Please call the surgeon at any time if you have
      questions. Our telephone number is 860-373-4148.</p>

    <h2>Candidates for cataract surgery:</h2>

    <p>Good candidates for cataract surgery include patients with cataract who:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Are bothered by their quality of vision</li>
      <li>Whose vision does not improve enough with new spectacles or contact lenses</li>
      <li>Are experiencing functional disability (eg difficulty reading, driving at night, seeing the TV)</li>
      <li>Are bothered by severe anisometropia or aniseikonia as a result of cataract surgery</li>
      <li>Have a medical condition for which cataract surgery would be helpful (e.g. phacomorphic angle
        closure glaucoma, pigment dispersion glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy where the cataract impairs
        your view of the retina)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that the standards for Medicare coverage of cataract surgery have changed. <b>There is no longer a
        requirement that the patient be 20/50 or worse for Medicare to cover surgery.</b> <a href="catComgtLCD.pdf"
        target="_blank">The Medicare Local Coverage Determination (LCD)</a> for cataract surgery now allows us to
      perform surgery when it is medically necessary and does not specify an arbitrary visual acuity standard for
      surgery.</p>

    <h2>Indications for co-management:</h2>

    <p>We strongly believe in the potential benefits of co-management for your patients. Co-management is usually more
      convenient for the patient and minimizes travel time. It allows their primary eye doctor to be more involved in
      their care and promotes a team approach in the perioperative period.</p>

    <p>Whether to co-manage is always the patient's choice. Most of our patients do choose to have their care
      co-managed, and we will notify you when the patient elects this option.</p>

    <h2>Referring a patient to us:</h2>

    <p>The best (and fastest) way to refer a patient to us is to use the <a href="https://see-view.info/referrals.php"
        target="_blank">online referral form</a>. Your front desk staff
      can enter basic information in the form and we will call the patient. It is HIPAA compliant and secure.
      If you give us the patient's cell phone number, they will automatically receive a text with our information.
      We will call the patient, and track the referral to make sure we see them and that you receive a letter.</p>

    <p>Of course, you can always call our office (860-373-4148) to refer a patient if you prefer.</p>

    <h2>Clinical pathway:</h2>

    <p>This is the usual schedule of visits for a patient having cataract surgery.</p>

        <td>At the initial consultation the surgeon takes a history to determine indications for surgery.
          He examines the patient for the presence of cataract and findings that may affect the surgery.
          He will discuss with your patient the risks, potential benefits, and alternatives of cataract surgery.
          Together, the patient and the surgeon will decide whether to schedule the procedure or not. If they
          schedule surgery, the patient will receive a date for a preoperative appointment. (S)he will also
          receive a handout on cataract surgery, directions to viewing educational material on our website, a
          booklet on the surgical center, and forms needed for scheduling the procedure.</td>
      </tr>
      <td>preop</td>
      <td>within 30 days of surgery</td>
      <td>surgeon</td>
      <td>The patient will have immersion A-scan ultrasonography at their preoperative appointment. The
        surgeon will then go over options for lenses. Together, the surgeon and patient will agree on a lens
        to be implanted. The patient receives prescriptions for perioperative medications to use, with written
        instructions on their use. We complete all paperwork and make postoperative appointments at this visit.

      <td>usually a Monday</td>
      <td>surgeon</td>
      <td>The surgery center staff will call the patient with a time for surgery. The patient will
        arrive at the Constitution Surgery Center East in Waterford. The entire process normally takes two
        hours. The actual procedure usually takes fifteen minutes, more if the surgery is complex. The
        patient will receive postoperative instructions prior to leaving the surgery center.</td>

      <td>This initial check is the most important one. At this visit, the physician asks how the patient
        feels, checks visual acuity and pressure, verifies good lens position, ensures no wound leak, and
        reviews the drop instructions with the patient. Because the patient is usually already dilated, this
        is a good time to perform a dilated examination. The patient's vision may be excellent, somewhat blurry,
        or poor at this visit. The physician reviews activity restrictions with the patient and answers any
        patient questions.</td>
      </tr>
      <td>postop 2</td>
      <td>1-2 weeks after surgery</td>
      <td>surgeon or optometrist</td>
      <td>At this check the physician asks the patient about their vision and comfort, checks visual acuity,
        IOP, and performs an anterior segment examination. Unless there is concurrent pathology that restricts
        vision (eg ARMD), the patient's best-corrected vision should be reasonably good at this visit.
        <b> If the patient is still phakic in one eye, it is important to review with the patient at
          this visit whether the patient still needs surgery in the other eye. Surgery may be cancelled if the
          patient is happy with their vision, and if there is no other indication for surgery.</b>

          wishes.</i></td>

      <td>postop 3</td>
      <td>3-4 weeks after surgery</td>

        satisfaction with their vision, checks visual acuity and IOP, examines their eyes for residual inflammation,
        and performs refraction. If needed, the physician gives the patient a prescription for spectacles. The
        physician makes appropriate followup appointments.</b></td>

    </table>

    <h2>Post-operative checks:</h2>

    <p>Some things to check after surgery include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patient perception of vision and comfort</li>
      <li>Patient satisfaction</li>
      <li>Visual acuity</li>
      <li>Refraction</li>
      <li>IOP</li>
      <li>Anterior chamber (shallowing, cell, lens particles)</li>
      <li>Corneal status (edema? wound leaks?)</li>
      <li>Lens (position, posterior capsular opacity)</li>
      <li>Posterior segment (if not already done)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Drops:</h2>

    <p>Below is a list of the usual drops our patients use for surgery. Sometimes their drops may differ from
      these, if the patient is allergic, or for financial or insurance reasons.</p>

    <p>The patient receives a written schedule for their drops at their preoperative appointment. If they
      need a new one, you can print it <a href="../patients/catPts/catDrops.html" target="_self">from our website.</a>
    </p>

    <table class="w3-table-all">
      <thead>
        <tr class="w3-red">
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Medications</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Starting 3 days before surgery</td>
        <td>Prolensa: 1 drop in the surgical eye 1x/day
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Starting after surgery</td>
        <td>Prolensa: 1 drop in the surgical eye 1x/day<br>
          Lotemax SM or prednisolone: 1 drop in the surgical eye 4x/day
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Starting five days after surgery</td>
        <td>Prolensa: 1 drop in the surgical eye 1x/day<br>
          Lotemax SM or prednisolone: 1 drop in the surgical eye 2x/day
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>30 days after surgery</td>
        <td>Stop all drops</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This course of medications may be adjusted based on the clinical situation, of course. Please note that we are
      no longer using perioperative antibiotic drops, as Dr. Cranmer uses intracameral moxifloxacin at the time of
      surgery.
      If the patient is allergic to fluoroquinolones, we will normally give that patient Polytrim drops (start 3 days
      preop, stop 5 days postop).</p>

    <p>Elevated IOP is common in the immediate postop period. Some ocular anti-hypertensives that are useful
      after surgery are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simbrinza</li>
      <li>latanoprost/Lumigan/Travatan Z/Vyzulta</li>
      <li>Combigan</li>
      <li>timolol and other beta-blockers</li>
      <li>Diamox Sequels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Avoid use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients who are sulfa allergic, and be careful about using
      beta-blockers in patients with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and others), cardiac issues (bradycardia or
      others), or diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Complications:</h2>

    <p>Please call the surgeon immediately for serious complications or for any questions regarding the post-operative
      care of the patient. Serious complications that you should call the surgeon for include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Persistently elevated eye pressure</li>
      <li>IOP over 40mmHg</li>
      <li>High IOP in a patient with significant glaucoma</li>
      <li>Unusually low IOP and/or flat anterior chamber</li>
      <li>Choroidal effusion or hemorrhage</li>
      <li>Hypopion</li>
      <li>Hyphema</li>
      <li>Unexplained visual loss</li>
      <li>Prolonged or severe corneal edema</li>
      <li>Cystoid macular edema</li>
      <li>Lens dislocation or malposition</li>
      <li>Worse vision than expected</li>
      <li>Significant patient dissatisfaction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are uncertain about how to best manage a complication, please call the surgeon.</p>
