        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        <p>Choosing the appropriate lens implant for your surgery is important. You will look through that lens for the
            rest of your life. The best lens for you depends on many factors, including the health of your eyes, how
            important it is to
            you to decrease your dependence on glasses, cost, and what activities are important to you. Be sure you
            understand the
            various choices available, and discuss with your surgeon what lens would be best for you.</p>
        <p>The lenses listed below
            are the ones we typically use. There are others available, such as accomodating lenses. We use the ones
            below because we have
            found them to be the most reliable and effective ones. If you have a lens in which your are interested that
            is not listed
            below, please discuss it with your surgeon.</p>

                        focal point. Glasses will often be needed for good vision at other focal points. Patients with

                        astigmatism may need glasses for all distances.</i></td>

                        astigmatism,
                        the surface of the eye is more curved in one direction than another. This blurs vision at all
                        distances, unless
                        it is corrected with a toric lens. Toric lenses can reduce astigmatism, so that clear vision is
                        possible at
                        one focal point. Toric lenses can reduce the need for glasses in patients with astigmatism.</i>

                <td class="w3-center"><b>monovision</b></td>
                <td><i>Monovision is not a particular lens type, but a technique used for reducing dependence on
                        glasses.
                        With monovision, the patient receives a monofocal lens (spherical, aspheric, or toric) in one
                        eye that is
                        focused at distance. The other eye is focused at near with another monofocal lens. This can
                        reduce or eliminate
                        the need for glasses in some patients. The patients who do the best with this method have worn
                        contact lenses that do this previously.
                        Many patients feel uncomfortable with the idea of this, and should not have monovision.
                        If you are considering monovision, you should consider simulating it in the clinic before your
                        surgery.</i></td>

                        implanted.
                        In most patients with multifocal lenses, the need for glasses is either reduced or eliminated.
                        Glasses are usually
                        needed in some situations, such as seeing tiny print up close, or reading in dim light, but some
                        patients are
                        entirely independent of glasses. Downsides of these lenses include cost, and an increased risk

                        with
                        astigmatism, they can correct the blur from astigmatism, and also give an extended range of
                        focus, like the
                        standard multifocal lens. Potential side effects of these lenses are the same as for the

                        wanted.
                        It is often still possible to adjust the optics after the cataract surgery has been performed. A
                        procedure called
                        LASIK (or sometimes one called PRK) can modify the eye's optics after cataract surgery and
                        reduce dependence on glasses.
                        Patients who had cataract surgery and did not achieve the result they wanted receive a
                        significant discount on these
                        procedures.</i></td>

        <p>Please understand that there is no guarantee of any particular outcome with any of these lenses. Although we
            have
            excellent techniques and technologies to help you achieve better vision, the results of surgery can vary,
            even when surgery goes
            perfectly. It is important to discuss with your surgeon your particular situation and goals before your
            surgery.</p>
