      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        It's important to understand that there are real risks involved in
        having cataracts, and in having cataract surgery. It is important to
        balance these risks against each other when deciding whether to have
        cataract surgery or not. There is a balance between the deteriorating
        vision you may have from a cataract, versus the risks involved in
        surgery to correct it. When the risks of cataract surgery are outweighed
        by the functional problems caused by the cataract, it is reasonable to
        consider proceeding with surgery.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way to think of cataract surgery is the way you think of driving:
        that most of the time, you get where you want to go, but you understand
        that sometimes it's possible to have an accident, even a catastrophic
        one. You still need to drive sometimes, but you don't drive unless you
        need to. You can think of cataract surgery the same way: don't do it
        unless you need to, but if you do, it's reasonable to proceed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please read on for some of the risks of having cataracts, versus the
        risks of cataract surgery. Please understand that it's not possible to
        list all possible risks. The lists below try to hit the most common and
        important ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks of cataracts</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone who lives long enough gets cataracts. Simply doing nothing has
        risks to your vision, as the cataracts will eventually degrade your
        ability to see, and may pose other health problems for your eyes.

          <td>Blurred vision</td>
          <td>
            Blurred vision worsens as cataracts progress. In the early stages of
            cataracts, vision is usually good. As the cataracts progress,
            however, vision deteriorates to the point where everything looks
            blurry, and no glasses are able to make it clearer.

        <tr>
          <td>Glare and halos</td>
          <td>
            Cataracts scatter light as it enters the eye. This causes rings
            around lights, particularly at night. Glare and halos can make night
            driving difficult.

        <tr>
          <td>Decrease in contrast sensitivity</td>
          <td>
            Cataracts decrease the ability to distinguish shades of grey. This
            degrades the quality of vision and can make driving in fog and rain
            difficult.

        <tr>
          <td>Optical changes</td>
          <td>
            As cataracts develop, the innate optics of the eye can change. This
            may mean you have to change your glasses more frequently than in the
            past. In some cases the change can actually be for the better
            ("second sight"). This can actually make some patients less
            dependent on glasses for a while as the cataracts develop. In the
            end, though, the cataract blurs vision to the point that with or
            without glasses, it's difficult to see.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Glaucoma</td>
          <td>
            As the cataract develops, the lens in the eye becomes physically
            larger. In rare cases, this can cause the lens to press on the eye's
            drainage system and close it off. This produces high eye pressure
            and can damage the nerve in the eye, a condition called glaucoma. If
            the glaucoma is bad enough, it can permanently damage vision.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Degraded view of the inside of the eye</td>
          <td>
            In order to evaluate the health of the eye, your eye doctor must be
            able to see inside it. Cataracts block the view inside the eye. Your
            doctor may not be able to make good decisions regarding the care of
            some diseases (diabetes, macular degeneration, glaucoma and others)
            if he or she can't see inside the eye.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Blindness</td>
          <td>
            Very advanced cataract can degrade vision to the point of blindness.
            In these cases, there is not total darkness, but vision can be so
            poor that it is impossible to see much beyond the presence or
            absence of light.

      <h2>Risks of cataract surgery</h2>
      <p>
        Cataract surgery is a generally safe procedure, but is not risk free.
        Some people think it is a "simple procedure where they peel a film off
        the eye." This is not true. Cataract surgery is a complex procedure that
        requires years of training to perform. Problems, and even true
        disasters, are possible. Evaluating and accepting these risks is very
        important prior to surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please understand that this is not a complete list of all the possible
        risks of cataract surgery. There are conceivable risks beyond the ones
        described below.

          <td>
            In the days after surgery, vision can be blurry, sometimes severely
            so. This is usually produced by swelling on the surface of the eye
            (the "cornea"). This normally resolves in a few days.

          <td>Common</td>

            After surgery, the eye may be irritated and scratchy. This usually

            You may see floaters after the surgery. Floaters come from a
            disturbance in the jelly inside the eye. They look like little
            spider webs floating around in your vision. By disturbing the inside
            of the eye, cataract surgery can cause floaters. Sometimes you can
            see more floaters after cataract surgery because you simply see
            better.

          <td>High eye pressure</td>
          <td>Common</td>
          <td>
            Inflammation caused by the surgery can elevate the pressure in the
            eye. This is usually temporary, and can be treated easily. In most
            cases, the high pressure produces no ill effects. In rare cases,
            however, the high pressure can damage the nerve in the eye and cause
            permanent visual loss.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dark crescent in side vision</td>
          <td>Common</td>
          <td>
            For reasons that are not fully understood, a dark crescent can be
            visible in a patient's side vision after surgery. This can be
            annoying, and sometimes interfere with function. It often resolves
            over time, but in some cases does not. In severe cases, additional
            surgery may be required to correct it.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Optical error</td>
          <td>Common</td>
          <td>
            We have good formulas for calculating the power of the lens to
            implant. These usually allow us to predict the optics in the eye
            after surgery, but they are not perfect. There is usually some minor
            error after surgery in the final result (astigmatism,
            nearsightedness, and/or farsightedness). In some cases this is
            significant, and rarely quite severe (a "refractive surprise"). This
            can be particularly disappointing for patients trying to reduce
            their dependence on glasses and contact lenses after surgery, such
            as those receiving astigmatism-correcting or multifocal lens
            implants. In some cases, additional procedures may be required to
            reduce this optical error.

          <td>Glare and/or halos</td>
          <td>Uncommon</td>
          <td>
            Cataract surgery usually improves glare symptoms. Some patients,
            however, experience glare after surgery that is worse than before
            surgery, or that does not fully resolve with surgery. Glare after
            surgery is more common with patients receiving multifocal lenses
            than monofocal lenses.

          <td>Failure to achieve intended result</td>
          <td>Uncommon</td>
          <td>
            Cataract surgery improves vision in the vast majority of patients.
            However, in some patients, there is no improvement. This can happen
            if there is co-existing eye disease, such as macular degeneration or
            diabetes. Rarely, vision can be worse after surgery, as in the case
            if there is a surgical complication, or post-operative issue such as
            retinal detachment or persistent swelling of the cornea or retina.

          <td>Droopy eyelid</td>
          <td>Uncommon</td>
          <td>
            Sometimes patients can develop a droopy eyelid after cataract
            surgery. This may be temporary or permanent. If it does not resolve
            and is a persistent problem, it may require surgery to correct.

          <td>
            Surgery is a very human process. Although there are strict protocols
            in place to reduce the chance of human error, it is still possible.
            Implanting the wrong lens, operating on the wrong eye, or making
            some other avoidable mistake is possible with surgery. Human error
            could produce unforeseen and and undesireable outcomes.

          <td>
            After cataract surgery, the surface of the eye (the "cornea") or the
            layer of nerves inside the eye (the "retina") can become swollen.
            These are usually temporary conditions, and can usually be treated
            with drops or by other means. In cases of swelling of the cornea,
            corneal transplant may be required to improve vision. In some cases,
            however, swelling of either the retina or cornea can permanently
            degrade vision.

          <td>Retinal tears and/or detachment</td>

          <td>
            There is a layer of nerves that wallpapers the inside of the
            eyeball. It is called the "retina." Cataract surgery increases the
            likelihood that this layer of nerves will separate from the inside
            wall of the eyeball. This is a serious condition called a "retinal
            detachment." It can happen at any time after surgery, even years
            later. It is often preceded by a tear in the retina. If not repaired
            in time, it can lead to blindness. Patients who are severely
            nearsighted before surgery are at higher risk of this occuring.

        <tr>
          <td>Capsular rupture</td>
          <td>Uncommon</td>
          <td>
            A thin capsule surrounds the natural lens in the eye. The capsule
            holds the natural lens in place in the eye, and is used to hold the
            new (plastic) lens implanted during cataract surgery. It is about
            one one-hundredth of a millimeter thick, and can rupture during
            surgery. This can allow lens fragments (or the entire lens) to fall
            back in the eye. Additional surgeries may be required to remove
            these fragments. Rupture of the capsule can increase the possibility
            of other complications of surgery, such as infection, retinal
            detachment, and swelling of the retina.

          <td>
            During the surgery, your surgeon normally breaks up the cataract
            inside your eye with an ultrasound probe. The fragments of the lens
            are vacuumed out with the same probe. Sometimes there can be
            fragments that are inadvertently left inside the eye, particularly
            if they becomed tucked behind the iris and are hidden from your
            surgeon. If there are retained fragments after your surgery, your
            surgeon may elect to leave them (they often dissolve with time). In
            some cases they need to be removed with a separate procedure,
            particularly if they are causing high eye pressure.

          <td>
            The lens in the eye (either the natural one or the implant) can
            become detached from its support system in the eye during surgery.
            This can require additional maneuvers to replace or remove it,
            either during the original surgery later, with other surgeries. In
            some cases, (mostly in patients with predisposing conditions) the
            lens can dislocate months or years later.

            Infection with modern cataract surgery is fortunately rare. If it

            Some minor bleeding from cataract surgery is common. This can occur
            on the surface of the eye from the incisions, or inside the eye
            during the surgery. In either case, the bleeding does not usually
            interfere with achieving good vision. In rare cases, however, severe
            bleeding in the eye can cause loss of vision, or even loss of the
            eye ("suprachoroidal hemorrhage" or "expulsive hemorrhage").

            We normally perform cataract surgery on one eye at a time, and do
            not perform it on the other eye until the first eye has healed
            adequately. However, true blindness in both eyes is possible if
            there is a blinding complication in one eye, in a patient who has
            only one good eye. If you have one eye that is permanently impaired,
            it is important to take extra care in weighing the risks of surgery
            in the other eye.
