        <h1 class="w3-center">Instructions for Cataract Surgery Medications</h1>

        <p>Itâ€™s important that you use your cataract surgery drops as instructed. 
        They help prevent infection and help you to heal.  If you have any questions about how to use 
        them, please call our office at 860-373-4148.</p>
        
        <p>This is the usual course of drops.  If your surgeon gave you different instructions, follow those.</p>

        <p>Your vision in the first days after surgery may be blurry and you may have some ache or scratchiness.  
        This is normal.  These symptoms should get gradually better, but never worse.  If you have worsening vision 
        or increasing discomfort in the days to weeks after surgery, call your surgeon at 860-373-4148.</p>
        
        <p>If you are unable to afford your drops, or they are very expensive, there may be alternatives.  Please call our office.</p>
        
        <p>If you are allergic to these medications, or ones that sound similar to them, do not take them.  Please call our office.</p>
