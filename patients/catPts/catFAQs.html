      <h2>What is a cataract?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a cataract, it means that the lens in your eye has become
        cloudy. We’re all born with a lens inside each of our eyes. The lens
        helps to focus light inside the eye so we can see. Over time, the lens
        becomes cloudy and interferes with vision.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some things you may notice if you have cataracts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Glare around lights at night</li>
        <li>Trouble reading in dim light</li>
        <li>Colors seem dull</li>
        <li>Double vision out of the eye(s) with the cataract</li>
        <li>General poor quality of vision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the early stages of a cataract the changes may not be noticeable.
        Very advanced cataracts can cause near-total blindness.
      </p>
      <h2>What causes cataracts?</h2>
      <p>
        Most cataracts develop over time as natural changes in the lens in the
        eye. The regular arrangement of proteins in the lens becomes disrupted,
        causing the lens to become cloudy. Sometimes, cataracts are the result
        of injury, steroid medication use, prior eye surgery, or other causes.
      </p>
      <h2>What can be done to prevent cataracts?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually there is nothing you can do to prevent cataracts. Everyone who
        lives long enough will develop cataracts. Some things will make them
        develop faster, such as smoking, steroid use, and injury, and avoiding
        these things, if possible, may delay the age at which you develop
        cataracts.
      </p>
      <h2>Will I go blind from cataracts?</h2>
      <p>
        Cataracts are reversible with surgery. If left untreated, vision can
        decline to the point of blindness, but even then it is usually possible
        to perform surgery and restore vision.
      </p>
      <h2>If I have cataracts, do I need surgery right away?</h2>
      <p>
        With very few exceptions, correcting cataracts with surgery is not an
        emergency. Most patients can wait years, and even decades, before
        needing surgery. In the early stages, cataracts will often change the
        prescription in your glasses, so just getting a new pair of glasses may
        make your vision better. Eventually, new glasses will not help enough,
        and surgery may be needed to correct the cataract.
      </p>
      <h2>When should I have cataract surgery?</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, it is best to have surgery when you are bothered by your
        vision, and the cataract is causing you some problem in your daily life.
        People with significant cataracts often have trouble with night driving,
        seeing the television, reading, or other visual tasks. If everything
        seems fine with your vision, you usually do not need cataract surgery.
        As the cataract develops, you will notice that your vision declines, and
        that you have difficulty seeing well enough to do the things you need to
        do and the things you enjoy. When the cataract interferes with your life
        in this way, you should consider surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Is there a medicine or nutritional supplement that I can take instead of
        having surgery?
      </h2>
      <p>
        No. Currently there is no known medical treatment for cataracts. New
        glasses will often make your vision better as the cataracts develop, but
        eventually the only treatment option is surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>How is cataract surgery performed?</h2>
      <p>
        Your cataract surgery will be a scheduled procedure in an operating
        room. During surgery, your surgeon will remove the cloudy lens and
        replace it with an artificial plastic one. You will receive anesthetics
        to prevent discomfort and make you relaxed.
      </p>
      <h2>Does it hurt?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually there is no pain with cataract surgery. In many cases you may
        not even remember the procedure after it is performed. After the
        surgery, your eye may be red and feel scratchy or feel like something is
        in it.
      </p>
      <h2>Is it done with laser?</h2>
      <p>
        There are various ways to remove a cataract. An ultrasound probe is used
        to break up and remove the cataract in most cases. We do not currently
        use lasers as part of the surgery, because they have not been shown to
        improve safety or outcomes of surgery, and they prolong the amount of
        time required.
      </p>
      <h2>Is cataract surgery safe?</h2>
      <p>
        No surgery is completely risk-free, but modern cataract surgery has a
        very high success rate. The vast majority of patients do very well, and
        enjoy significant improvement in their vision. Complications, while
        rare, can happen. When complications occur, it is usually possible to
        recover from them.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the risks of cataract surgery?</h2>
      <p>
        Like all surgeries, cataract surgery has risks. You should weigh these
        risks against the potential benefits of the surgery in deciding whether
        to undergo it. Common, less serious risks include blurred vision or
        discomfort for a few days after surgery, a dark area in your peripheral
        vision, floaters, sensitivity to bright lights, increased eye pressure,
        or a droopy eyelid. More serious risks are rare, but it is possible to
        have a complication that permanently impairs your vision, or requires
        additional surgery or medical treatments to correct. These include
        rupture of the capsule that holds the natural lens, infection,
        detachment of the nerve layer inside the eye (the “retina”), swelling of
        the retina, or permanent swelling of the clear dome over the surface of
        the eye (the “cornea”). Fortunately, most patients do not experience
        these things, and do very well with their surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>Are there any guarantees?</h2>
      <p>
        No. You and your surgeon will work together as a team to try to get you
        the best vision possible, but there are no guarantees as to a particular
        outcome for your surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>Will I be glasses-free after my surgery?</h2>
      <p>
        Cataract surgery is an exciting opportunity to change the optics in your
        eyes and refocus them. In many cases it is possible to correct
        nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism at the time of surgery.
        This is done by choosing an appropriate lens to implant at the time of
        surgery. If you are interested in trying to decrease your dependence on
        glasses after surgery, you should discuss this with your surgeon before
        the operation. There are some lens implants that are specifically
        designed to reduce your dependence on glasses after surgery. Some, but
        not all of these lenses have extra charges that are not covered by your
        insurance. It is important that you consider your choices before the
        surgery, because the lens you have implanted will be with you for the
        rest of your life.
      </p>
      <h2>Is surgery covered by insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Cataract surgery is covered by almost all medical insurance plans,
        including Medicare, as long as you meet certain criteria for visual
        disability. It is not usually covered by “vision” plans. You may be
        responsible for co-pays for the surgery, including for the facility fee
        and/or anesthesia services. In addition, if you select a specialty lens
        (such as astigmatism-correcting lenses or multifocal lenses) or require
        non-standard additional services, there may be charges for these. You
        should ask the surgical coordinator for an estimate of these charges
        prior to surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>If I decide to have cataract surgery, how do I schedule it?</h2>
      <p>
        To schedule cataract surgery, let your surgeon know that you would like
        to proceed. The surgical coordinator at the practice will get you a date
        for preoperative testing and for the surgery, and will arrange the
        logistics of the procedure.
      </p>
      <h2>What if I have other questions about the cataracts?</h2>
      <p>
        You should ask your physician if you have other questions about
        cataracts, particularly if you are considering surgery. You should never
        decide to have cataract surgery if you do not feel fully informed.
