<h4>How to</h4>

<p><i>To get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask to see or get a copy of the medical and billing records we maintain about you, in 
  either electronic or paper media. If you make the request in person or you call by telephone, we normally 
  do not require the request in writing. We may require a written request if it comes from someone other 
  than you. If it comes from a physician or other clinician we know to be involved in your care, we normally 
  do not require a written request.</li>
	<li>We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. 
  We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee for this.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To correct your medical record:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask us to correct health information about you that you think is incorrect or incomplete. Ask 
  us how to do this.</li>
	<li>We may say “no” to your request if we disagree about your correction, but we will put a notation about 
  your request in the medical record if you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To request confidential communications:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask us to contact you in a specific way (for example, home or office phone) or to send mail 
  to a different address.</li> 
	<li>We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To ask us to limit what we use or share:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask us not to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. 
  We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if we believe it would affect your care.</li>
	<li>If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that 
  information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a 
  law requires us to share that information.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To get a list of those with whom we’ve shared information:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior 
  to the date you ask, with whom we shared it, and why.</li>
	<li>We will include all the disclosures except for those about treatment, payment, and health care operations, 
  and certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make). We’ll provide one accounting a year for free 
  but will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another one within 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To get a copy of this privacy notice:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can ask for a paper copy of this notice at any time, even if you have agreed to receive the notice 
  electronically.</li>
	<li>We will provide you with a paper copy promptly.  You can also print this notice from our website.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To choose someone to act for you:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person 
  can exercise your rights and make choices about your health information.</li>
	<li>We will make sure the person has this authority and can act for you before we take any action.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To file a complaint if you feel your rights are violated:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can complain if you feel we have violated your rights by contacting our privacy officer. Our 
  privacy officer will discuss your complaint with you and investigate if needed. We will issue you a written 
  report of the investigation if you request it.</li>
	<li>You can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights 
  by sending a letter to 200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201, calling 1-877-696-6775, or 
  visiting www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/complaints/.</li>
