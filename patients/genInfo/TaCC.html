      <h2 class="w3-center">Terms and Conditions of Care</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for choosing Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC for your eye
        care. We appreciate the trust you have placed in us to take care of your
        eyes and your vision. In order to become and continue as a patient with
        us, you must agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not
        agree to these terms and conditions, we would be happy to refer you to
        another eye care practice.
      </p>

      <h4>Consent for care:</h4>

      <p>
        By becoming our patient, you authorize the physician(s), staff,
        consultants, and contractors of Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC, to
        render appropriate medical and surgical eye care to you. You understand
        that the practice of medicine and surgery involves risk, and although we
        endeavor to minimize this risk, it can not be eliminated. Examinations,
        dilation, medications, surgical procedures, testing, imaging, and many
        of the other things we do here have potential danger to your comfort,
        vision, health, and even life. In consenting to care, you understand
        this risk and accept it.
      </p>

      <h4>Dilation of your eyes:</h4>

      <p>
        We often use dilating drops to allow your doctor to adequately examine
        your eyes, and to properly screen for, diagnose, and treat eye diseases.
        These drops cause the pupil (the black circle in the center of your eye)
        to become enlarged. This allows your physician to see the inside of the
        eye, for a better view of the important structures in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dilation may cause blurred vision and sensitivity to bright lights. This
        effect varies from person to person, and may be much more severe in some
        than others. It may interfere with your activities, and may make it
        difficult or unsafe to drive. The decision to drive or not is yours
        alone, and you take responsibility for your decision if you do drive. We
        recommend that you bring a driver with you the first time you are
        dilated, so you see the effect of the dilation. Based on this
        experience, you can decide whether or not it will be safe for you to
        drive the next time you are dilated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dilating drops may require up to thirty minutes to work. This can
        sometimes prolong the time needed for your visit with us. Please plan
        accordingly. In most cases, the effects of dilation last less than four
        hours, but some may last for days, or even weeks.
      </p>

      <h4>Limited exams:</h4>

      <p>
        Unless you are seeing us for a complete eye exam, we may perform a
        limited exam. Limited exams are based on certain problems you have, or
        problems another doctor or care provider asked us to evaluate. Some
        examples of this include a new patient seeing us for pink eye, or a
        patient referred to us for evaluation of droopy eyelids. In cases such
        as these, we may chose to limit our examination to the issue at hand,
        and not perform a full eye exam. With a limited exam, we may not screen
        for conditions such as diabetic eye disease, macular degeneration, or
        glaucoma. By agreeing to be our patient, you agree that you will
        schedule a complete eye examination with either us or your usual eye
        doctor, and follow your doctor's recommendations for regular follow-ups.
        Failure to adhere to a regular schedule of eye examinations can result
        in important diagnoses being missed, and the potential for preventable
        visual disability.
      </p>

      <h4>Use of off-label medications:</h4>

      <p>
        Many medications in the United States are used "off-label." This means
        that a medication is used to treat a condition for which it did not
        receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. An example of
        this is using antibiotic drops that were approved to treat pink eye to
        prevent infection after cataract surgery. This is a common, legal, and
        appropriate practice. Medications may be used off-label if, in the
        judgment of your physician, it would be beneficial to you to do so.
        Because so many of our medications are used off-label, we will generally
        not tell you whether a medication is being used according to its FDA
        approved indication or not. If you would like to know, please ask your
        physician.
      </p>

      <h4>Acknowledgement of receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices:</h4>

      <p>
        The most current notice of our privacy practices is provided to you on
        our website (see-care.com). If you would like a paper copy we would be
        happy to print one for you, or you can print it yourself directly from
        our website.
      </p>

      <h4>Agreement as to resolution of concerns:</h4>

      <p>
        By becoming a patient at Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC you
        understand that you are entering into a contractual relationship with
        our physician(s) ("Physician") for professional care. You further
        understand that meritless and frivolous claims for medical malpractice
        have an adverse effect upon the cost and availability of medical care to
        patients, and may result in irreparable harm to a medical provider. As
        additional consideration for professional care provided to you by
        Physician, you, the Patient/Guardian, agree not to initiate or advance,
        directly or indirectly, any meritless or frivolous claims of medical
        malpractice against Physician.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should you initiate or pursue a meritorious medical malpractice claim
        against Physician, you agree to use as expert witnesses (with respect to
        issues concerning the standard of care), only physicians who are board
        certified by the American Board of Ophthalmology, and whose primary
        source of income is from the practice of medicine. Further, you agree
        that these physicians retained by you or on your behalf to be expert
        witnesses will be members in good standing of the American Academy of
        Ophthalmology. You agree the expert will be obligated to adhere to the
        Code of Ethics defined by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (copy
        available at www.aao.org).
      </p>

      <p>
        You agree to require any attorney you hire and any physician hired by
        you or on your behalf as an expert witness to agree to these provisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In further consideration, Physician also agrees to exactly the same
        above-referenced stipulations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each party agrees that a conclusion by a specialty society affording due
        process to an expert will be treated as supporting or refuting evidence
        of a frivolous or meritless claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Patient/guardian and Physician agree that this Agreement is binding upon
        them individually and their respective successors, assigns,
        representatives, personal representatives, spouses, and other
        dependents. Physician and Patient/Guardian agree that these provisions
        apply to any claim for medical malpractice whether based on a theory of
        contract, negligence, battery, or any other theory of recovery.
        Patient/Guardian acknowledges that he/she has been given ample
        opportunity to read this agreement and to ask questions about it, and to
        consult with an attorney if needed.
      </p>

      <h4>Medicare signature on file:</h4>

      <p>
        You request that payment of authorized Medicare benefits to be made
        either to you or on your behalf be paid to Southeast Connecticut Eye
        Care LLC for any services furnished to you by our physician(s). You
        authorize any holder of medical information about yourself to release to
        the Centers for Medicare Services, your Medigap insurer if applicable,
        and its agents any information needed to determine benefits for related
        services.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Assignment of insurance payments and release of medical information:
      </h4>

      <p>
        By becoming a patient of Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC you agree to
        assign payments for services rendered to be paid by your insurance
        company to your clinician, and that Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC
        may release medical information to your insurance company in accordance
        with applicable law.
      </p>

      <h4>Patient responsibility statement:</h4>

      <p>
        It is your responsibility to obtain an insurance referral if required by
        your plan. You also agree to pay any co-pay, deductible or coinsurance
        due. You agree to pay any fees and charges due that are not covered by
        your insurance, and that you will be responsible for collection fees
        (including reasonable attorney fees and court costs) if collection
        proceedings become necessary.
      </p>

      <h4>Late policy:</h4>

      <p>
        In consideration of other patients of Southeast Connecticut Eye Care
        LLC, please be on time to your appointments. Being late can delay our
        entire schedule for the day, and inconvenience other patients. If you
        are late to your appointment, we will attempt to see you if doing so
        would not interfere with the care of other patients. If we are unable to
        see you, we may need to reschedule your appointment to another time or
        day. If we need to reschedule your appointment, we treat the incident as
        a missed appointment.
      </p>

      <h4>Missed appointments:</h4>

      <p>
        We devote considerable resources to seeing you for eye care. Missed
        appointments deny other patients the availability of these resources and
        impose costs on our practice. While we endeavor to remind you of
        appointments by various means, it is your responsibility to report for
        your appointment as scheduled. If you miss an appointment the following
        policy applies.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          For your first missed appointment in one year, we give you a courtesy
          call and will reschedule your appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          For your second missed appointment in one year, we impose a charge of
          $20 and will reschedule your appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          For your third missed appointment in one year, we impose a charge of
          $50 and will reschedule your appointment, or may discharge you from
          our practice (i.e. we will not see you, except for thirty days of
          emergency care), at our discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          For any subsequent missed appointments, we will discharge you from our
          practice.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We understand there may be circumstances beyond your control that
        prevent you from coming to your appointments. If there are exceptional
        circumstances that interfere with your visit, please let us know as soon
        as possible. We may forgive missed appointments at our discretion.
      </p>

      <h4>Cancellation policy:</h4>

      <p>
        If you wish to cancel an appointment, you must do so no later than
        twenty-four (24) hours prior to its scheduled time. Canceling later than
        this is treated as a missed appointment, except in exceptional
        circumstances.
      </p>

      <h4>Access to care:</h4>

      <p>
        We try to take care of all patients who seek our care. If you are unable
        to afford the costs of your care, please ask for an appointment with our
        office manager for financial counseling. We may be able to offer you
        payment plans, reduced price care, or other accomodations as needed. We
        may ask for documentation of financial need (such as tax forms) to
        determine eligibility.
      </p>

      <h4>Use of cell phones:</h4>

      <p>
        You may use cell phones in our office, but please be discrete and
        considerate of other patients. We ask that you not use a cell phone in
        the clinical area when a technician or physician is present.
      </p>

      <h4>Food and drink:</h4>

      <p>
        Because of the presence of precision optical and digital equipment, food
        and drinks are not permitted in the clinical area. You may leave food
        and drink at the front desk reception area if needed.
      </p>

      <h4>Tobacco and tobacco products:</h4>

      <p>
        Use of tobacco or tobacco products (including electronic cigarettes,
        snuff, and chewing tobacco) is not permitted anywhere in buildings
        occupied by Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC.
      </p>

      <h4>Weapons, illicit drugs, and alcoholic beverages</h4>

      <p>
        Weapons, illicit drugs (including marijuana), and alcoholic beverages
        are not permitted anywhere in buildings occupied by Southeast
        Connecticut Eye Care LLC.
      </p>

      <h4>Prescription of medical marijuana:</h4>

      <p>
        Because marijuana continues to be classified as an illicit drug by the
        US Government, we do not provide prescriptions for its use, regardless
        of any scientific evidence regarding clinical efficacy.
      </p>

      <h4>Updates to these Terms and Conditions of Care:</h4>

      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions of Care may be amended, updated, and changed
        at any time and without notice by Southeast Connecticut Eye Care LLC.
        You agree to comply with the current version. The current version of
        these Terms and Conditions of Care is available at see-care.com. We are
        happy to provide you with a paper copy at no charge upon demand.
